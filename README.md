# An Easy_illness_prediction program

This program has two parts:
1. Model 1: predition in a short time : based on grey-predict-model, which in this program should only be used in a rising trend of rate of increase;
2. Model 2: predition in a long time : also named "SEIRD", which sometime used in knowing this kind of program but not usually used by predicting. But of course this one can be changed to used in a prediction modeln by adding a self-reacting robot with the parameters I provide .


In part one, the main-function named "illness_statistical.m"
In part two, the main-function named "test.m"
The rule of parameters` name making is reffers to "illness_model.m"
